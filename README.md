# online-learning-platform
To create an Online Learning Platform with a React frontend and Node.js backend,  design user and admin interfaces, authentication mechanisms, and RESTful API endpoints.

This project is an Admin Dashboard for an Online Learning Platform where administrators can manage courses and users. It includes a frontend built with React for the user interface and a backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle data and server logic.

The backend is responsible for managing user authentication and providing APIs for course management. Administrators can add, update, view, and delete courses through secure routes that require JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access and modify data.

The frontend provides displaying course information. Admins can log in, navigate to the dashboard, and see a list of courses where each course can be edited or removed directly. The application uses Axios to handle API requests, making it responsive and interactive.
